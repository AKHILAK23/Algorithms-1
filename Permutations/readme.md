The problem is to print all the permutations of a string.
A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length n has n! permutation.
Here a string is given in input.txt.By reading the string in this file,program is executed and all the permutations of the given string is displayed.To show that the no of permutations is n! for a string of length n,each permutation of the string is numbered while displaying.
If the input is "permute",5040 permutations of it are printed as output.
code file is permutations.c and input file is input.txt
